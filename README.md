# FileScreen
A fun project started before my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing course. I got back on the project yesterday and finished it. This console project is a simple file screener for text files confirming a file type, amount of lines, lines with content and some binary information on same.

I started it as a small fun project to practice my C# and get a little functionality into it in the process. No plans for development on it as its a one feature build that was built for purpose of having fun whilst coding only.

Futher information and contact to myself at johnmlhll@yahoo.com and you can follow me on Twitter @johnmlhll. If I see you are a coder and/or in the software industry, I will follow you back when I see your follow!
